# Hello, I'm Ahmad Yazid Munif

Currently I am a fresh graduate and have obtained a bachelor's degree in informatics engineering from Trunojoyo
Madurese University. Throughout my studies till now, I've learned a lot more about software development, esp
web-based software and dealing with data (databases). Python is my first language, exploring the front & back-end of the web. Currently I am interested in studying data analysis by looking at data that has now turned into a larger data set, so that a problem can be solved by finding patterns from the data, so that is a challenge for me.
