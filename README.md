# Hello, I'm Ahmad Yazid Munif


I'm a dedicated software engineer with over 3 years of experience, mainly focused on backend logic and building reliable, scalable applications. 
Currently, I work as a Salesforce Developer, where I deal with business logic, integrations, and custom features. With a strong foundation in programming, I can adapt quickly to new technologies and languages. I
continue to improve my full-stack skills, aiming to build end-to-end solutions that are clean, maintainable, and practical for real-world use. 
I believe in continuous learning and teamwork, and I enjoy collaborating with others to deliver solutions that truly support business needs.
